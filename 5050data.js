//Just kidding, it's not just the data it's also the selectors in here. I dunno if I'd call that data so I'm writing this just as a headsup.

const output = document.querySelector("#output");
const goButton = document.querySelector("#the-singular-button-on-the-page");

const answers = {
  yes: [
    "Yes",
    "Go for it",
    "Let's do it",
    "Of course",
    "I'm down",
    "Sure",
    "Survey says: YES",
    "Positive"
  ],
  no: [
    "No",
    "Don't do it",
    "I'm not down",
    "Nevermind",
    "Let's not",
    "Survey says: NO",
    "Negative"
  ],
};
